These folders contain the MATLAB code used in Liam Rees's 2024 Thesis at UTS. All credit for the code is given to the original authors, which can be found in the code of each matlab script. There is a readme in wavestrapping that credits the original authors of the code. 

Folder Explanations and Credit:

batchimagecheck contains the MATLAB used to generate fractal D of all images for the analysis. All credit for this code goes to Zoey Isherwood. 

fractaledgedetection contains the MATLAB script used for generating edge detected visualiations of nature and wavestrapped images. It can also be used to generate an image's fractal dimension based on this edge detection. However, for our Thesis we found the edge detection didn't accurately capture all edges in image's with enough precision for our fractal analysis. 

wavestrapping contains the MATLAB code used to generate the wavestrapped images.
