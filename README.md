These folders contain the MATLAB code used in Liam Rees's 2024 Thesis at UTS. All credit for the code is given to the original authors, which can be found in the code of each matlab script. There is a readme in wavestrapping that credits the original authors of the code. 

Folder Explanations and Credit:

Rcode contains all the code used in R mentioned throughout the Thesis. This will continue to be updated after Thesis submission.

PsyToolKit Scripts include the full custom coded Survey script for PsyToolKit along with an example of one of the experiment conditions.

batchimagecheck contains the MATLAB used to generate fractal D of all images for the analysis. All credit for this code goes to Zoey Isherwood. 

fractaledgedetection contains the MATLAB script used for generating edge detected visualiations of nature and wavestrapped images. It can also be used to generate an image's fractal dimension based on this edge detection. However, for our Thesis we found the edge detection didn't accurately capture edges in images with enough precision for calculation of fractal D. 

wavestrapping contains the MATLAB code used to generate the wavestrapped images. Credit for this code goes to the authors of this paper Puckett AM, Schira MM, Isherwood ZJ, Victor JD, Roberts JA, and Breakspear M. (2020) "Manipulating the structure of natural scenes using wavelets to study the functional architecture of perceptual hierarchies in the brain" NeuroImage. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920306595 . The modified script that I used is createStimuli_Thesis.m within the wavestrapped folder. 

Final Images.zip contains the final images used in the Thesis including biophilic and AI images. 

cool_wombat.avi is an example of a wavestrapped image being reassembled in video. Credit goes to Puckett AM, Schira MM, Isherwood ZJ, Victor JD, Roberts JA, and Breakspear M. (2020) "Manipulating the structure of natural scenes using wavelets to study the functional architecture of perceptual hierarchies in the brain" NeuroImage. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920306595 . The modified script that I used is createStimuli_Thesis.m within the wavestrapped folder.
